DONE - Commits are a problem right now.
    -m doesn't work because of popen, must use a file

    this fix is to use subprocess
    
- -q doesn't make sense for some of the commands

- parallelize all the git calls

- this doesn't work with subdirectories, so any repos in directories below don't get handled.
    Maybe we can fix this?
    
- Ability to specifiy a list of repos to work on

- Show repos not on specified branch

- Bad arguments cause stack trace
